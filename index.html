		<p class="Intro">
			Codingal is a platform that empowers young coders through innovation. Founded in 2019 by IIT Bombay alumni<b> Vivek Prakash and Satyam Baranwal</b>, the idea behind Codingal was to provide young learners with a comprehensive and personalized approach to coding education. Their vision was to create a platform that would enable students to develop a strong foundation in coding and build their problem-solving skills from an early age.

			The founders of Codingal understood the importance of coding education and the increasing demand for skilled coders in the tech industry. They recognized that traditional methods of teaching coding were often ineffective and lacked personalization. Therefore, they set out to build a platform that would not only make coding fun and engaging but also provide students with a personalized learning experience.

			Over the past two years, Codingal has grown rapidly, with a mission to make coding education accessible to students all over the world. The platform has received tremendous support from parents, educators, and the larger coding community, with its innovative approach to coding education and commitment to student success. In this blog, we will explore the journey of Codingal, its founders, and their vision for the future of coding education.
